# LEAH

Hello, you most likely found this GitHub from Ponytown.
I'm Leah, im 13 years old turning 14. I have adhd, mood swings, bipolar, anger issues, social anxiety and OCD. Most of these prevent me from socializing which is why im kind of an asshole when I first meet you. if anything I do/did makes you upset/uncomfortable/ect, please let me know asap so I can stop. Also I can get anti social towards friends really easily so if I start randomly avoiding you (my friends) then please know that its not your fault.
